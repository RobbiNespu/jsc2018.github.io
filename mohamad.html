                <h3>CLINICAL GOVERNANCE IN DENTAL PRACTICE </h3>
                <p><br>The escalating cost of health care, including oral health care, led consumers to demand value for money spent.  The profession reiterates that it is committed to continual improvement in health care delivery through a system of clinical governance that emphasises accountability in quality outcome of care. The aim of this presentation is to explore the relationship of the elements that form the framework of clinical governance for promoting the attainment of oral health for improved health and enhanced quality of life. The overriding principle of clinical governance is providing health care to benefit the patient.  It evolved from the unwritten social contract between the medical-dental profession and the society whereby the former provides the best possible care for the latter’s trust. In the context of clinical governance, responsible health care organisations need to conform to the legislative requirements for patient care. They are also required to comply with the policies and procedures as advocated by the government and professional bodies. The dentist, whose overriding duty is to the patient, is obliged to provide the leadership in providing oral health care based on the concept of patient-centred care and patient safety. Patients as clients are given the opportunity to give feedback on care received. The Client’s Charter that forms the “social pact” between the service provider and consumers is central to an effective clinical governance. This framework of clinical governance underlined the importance of the competence and ability of dental practitioners to manage risks for effective, efficient and accountable oral health services that satisfies their patients. It operates within the context of the ethical principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, justice and autonomy. Dental practitioners and dental organisations are duty-bound to adopt the principles of clinical governance for continual improvement of quality patient care and patient satisfaction.
