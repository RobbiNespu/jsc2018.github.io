                <h3>UClinical Research- Opportunities and Challenges for Dental Professionals </h3>
                <p><br>Clinical research is a systematic investigation to test hypotheses and to generate generalizable knowledge.  The aim of clinical research is to find better ways to prevent, screen and diagnose illness and to treat patients.  Hence, clinical research is the essence of medical progress. Healthcare professionals in MOH, including dental specialists have been conducting investigator initiated research and publish their findings in peer review journals. The regular population based oral surveys have provided essential information for the dental practice and policy in dental services. Clinical research is one of the Entry Point Projects in the National Key Economic Areas. The setting up of Clinical Research Malaysia, a not– or – profit organisation that provides support and resources to clinical investigators and acts as an one-stop centre to  multi-national pharmaceutical and medical device companies seeking healthcare professionals to conduct clinical trials. There are many opportunities for dental specialist to conduct industry sponsored research.  The challenges faced by researchers in the MOH include research governance especially when it involves collaborative research, avoiding duplication in research areas and conducting research which can be translated into practice and policy. The establishment of the network of Clinical Research Centres with 33 Hospital CRC will provide assistance to staff at MOH, to increase the number and more so, to improve the quality of clinical research, so that the research findings can bring impact to the standard of healthcare.
